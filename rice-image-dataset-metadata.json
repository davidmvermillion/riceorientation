These varieties are separated from each other due to some of their features. These are usually features such as texture, shape, and color. With these features that distinguish rice varieties, it is possible to classify and evaluate the quality of seeds. In this study, Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag, which are five different varieties of rice often grown in Turkey, were used. A total of 75,000 grain images, 15,000 from each of these varieties, are included in the dataset. A second dataset with 106 features including 12 morphological, 4 shape and 90 color features obtained from these images was used. Models were created by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms for the feature dataset and by using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm for the image dataset, and classification processes were performed. Statistical results of sensitivity, specificity, prediction, F1 score, accuracy, false positive rate and false negative rate were calculated using the confusion matrix values of the models and the results of each model were given in tables. Classification successes from the models were achieved as 99.87% for ANN, 99.95% for DNN and 100% for CNN. With the results, it is seen that the models used in the study in the classification of rice varieties can be applied successfully in this field."}
